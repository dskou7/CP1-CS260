        <p>GRF-1N Griffin<br>
        Weight Class: Medium<br>
        Weight: 55 Tons<br>
        Armor Tonnage: 9.5<br>
        Armament:<br>
        PPC (RA)<br>
        LRM 10 (RT)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info1">
        <p>The primary weapon on the Griffin is a Fusigon PPC in the right arm.
          The PPC allows the Griffin to work in a long-range fire support role and is backed up by a Delta Dart LRM-10 launcher mounted in a drum over the right shoulder.
          The LRM launcher also gives the Griffin some indirect fire support capabilities and the two tons of reloads in the right torso allows for good endurance.
          The Achilles' heel of the design is its lack of short-range weapons,
          for when an enemy is capable of closing ranges and engaging in close quarters combat, and the fact that all of its weapons are located on the right side.
          The 'Mech is however equipped with two powerful battle fists for hand-to-hand combat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info2">
        <p>Built in 2492, the Griffin was originally classified as a heavy BattleMech,
          filling in the weight gap between mammoth machines like the Mackie and smaller recon 'Mechs like the Wasp, and intended for close assaults.
          Combining tremendous speed and firepower in one frame the Griffin briefly dominated in this role before being superseded by larger and better-equipped 'Mechs.
          However the Griffin was very popular among commanders and pilots alike and so Earthwerks Incorporated kept it in production,
          this time reclassified as a medium 'Mech and tasked with long-range fire support for medium lances.
          In this capacity the Griffin has excelled, combining good striking power, endurance and speed, with its only major weakness being a lack of close-range defensive weapons.</p>

        Weight Class: Medium<br>
        Weight: 45 Tons<br>
        Armor Tonnage: 9.0<br>
        Armament:<br>
        PPC (RA)<br>
        LRM 5 (LT)<br>
        Medium Laser (HD)<br>
        Small Laser (LA)<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info1">
        <p>The Vindicator carries as its primary weapon a Ceres Arms Smasher PPC in its right arm,
          giving the 'Mech a weapon capable of striking at long ranges and doing a respectable amount of damage.
          The weapon also features an innovative cooling jacket which possesses water intake ports around the muzzle,
          allowing the pilot to dip the PPC into a body of water and quickly cool it, with steam exiting via a nozzle at the opposite end.
          However this process leaves the Vindicator vulnerable as it must kneel motionless for ten seconds.
          As a secondary long-range weapon and giving the 'Mech indirect support capability is the Sian/Ceres Jaguar LRM-5,
          mounted on the 'Mechs left torso behind an armored door and supplied by one ton of ammunition.
          An extremely reliable system, the Jaguar can take quite a bit of abuse before it is shut down.
          Finally, for close range work, the Vindicator carries a head-mounted Ceres Arms Medium Laser and a Hessen IX Small Laser in its left arm.
          The Hessen laser was the result of the Confederation forcing Ceres to use at least one non-proprietary weapon system as a way of "stimulating domestic trade."
          Engineers had considered giving the Vindicator two PPCs but such a set-up would overburden its cooling system and leave it with no free hand to carry items.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info2">
        <p>The Vindicator is one of the most well known Capellan Confederation BattleMechs.
          This workhorse of the CCAF was built in 2826 between the First and Second Succession War to maximize
          the effectiveness of the Confederation's production capabilities and fulfill as many roles as possible.
          Designed by committee, the Vindicator's "jack-of-all-trades" nature means it does not excel in any one role but fulfills them adequately.
          With almost all of its components produced on Capella, the Vindicator is also cheap,
          easy to mass produce, and quick to repair with a ready supply of spare parts.</p>

        Armor Tonnage: 9.0<br>
        Armament:<br>
        PPC (RA)<br>
        SRM 4 (CT)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info1">
        <p>The Panther's primary weapon is a Lord's Light PPC mounted in the right arm and boasting one of the highest damage outputs of any weapon.
          Unfortunately the PPC is also one of the most heat intensive,
          though many officers see it as a good learning opportunity for raw recruits to spend their first years piloting the Panther
          and gain experience managing its heat curve with thirteen heat sinks.
          The PPC is backed up by a reliable Telos Four-Shot SRM-4 launcher mounted in the center torso supplied by a ton of ammunition in the left torso.
          This mix of long and short-range weapons allows the Panther to stay at range and inflict damage on its enemies and close in and use the SRM-4 to make the killing blow.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info2">
        <p>The Panther is one of the BattleMechs that is most iconic of the Draconis Combine.
          The design was originally commissioned in 2739 at the behest of the Star League to provide fire support for other light,
          fast-moving 'Mech units, with the first models going to the SLDF to fight bandits along the Periphery border.
          The original PNT-8Z model underwent a revision after the disastrous Battle of St. John in 2759, when it was revealed that its main weapon,
          a Tronel Large Laser, was inefficient in both range and firepower for the immense waste heat generated.
          Luckily the Panther had also proved itself to be quite hardy, sporting six and a half tons of armor, and maneuverable,
          thanks to four Lexington Lifter jump jets split between both legs for a total jumping distance of 120 meters,
          thus an attempt to fix its one deficiency was made by League engineers by replacing the laser with a Lord's Light Particle Projection Cannon.
          The swap in weaponry, along with a superior armor composite,
          gave the PNT-9R Panther a new lease on life, such that it has seen over three centuries of continuous use since its introduction.</p>

        <p>In 2463 Coventry Metal Works (then known as Coventry Defense Conglomerate) introduced their second BattleMech, the COM-1A Commando.
          Created for the Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces and one of the first 'Mechs ever designed for reconnaissance,
          the Commando was much lighter and faster than its precursors, though it still utilized primitive BattleMech technology.
          The Commando was able to destroy much heavier Kuritan Gladiators during the first large-scale battle between BattleMechs in 2475 on Nox.</p>

        <p>The main weapon of the Locust was a single Martell Medium Laser mounted in the center torso.
          Backing this up were two Sperry Browning Machine Guns, which effectively deterred infantry attacks against the Locust's vulnerable legs.
          These were located in either arm and fed by a one-ton ammo bin located in the center torso.
          Lacking hand actuators the Locust was vulnerable to other 'Mechs when engaging in close combat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info2">
        <p>The Locust was one of the most common BattleMechs in existence, having been in continuous production since the design was first introduced by Bergan Industries in 2499.
          One of the smallest 'Mechs ever built, the Locust was designed exclusively for reconnaissance and quick strike missions, using its then-phenomenal speed to outrun most enemies.
          In a situation where it was unable to outrun its enemies, the 'Mech did have a light array of weapons with which to defend itself,
          but the Locust lacked the firepower or staying power to be a true front-line combatant and as a result few MechWarriors enjoyed piloting Locusts.
          Within its weight-class though the Locust was considered an excellent 'Mech, overshadowed as a scout only by designs which mounted jump jets.
          Often when a Locust engaged in combat it was as a holding action until reinforcements could arrive,
          although when operating in groups of three they could swarm lone enemy 'Mechs which became separated from friendly support.</p>
